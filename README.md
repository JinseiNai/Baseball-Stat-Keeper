# Sports Stat Keeper

Sports Stat Keeper is website / application that allows the user (typically for managers/coaches) to resister their team and players into a database.

The user will then be able to view and or add stats for each game the players play.

Sports Stat Keeper will then automatically calculate the newly added stat numbers with previous existing ones (if any) and update the players' stat lines.
